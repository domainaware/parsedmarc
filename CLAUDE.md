This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Model roles for feature work

Any new feature or modification to an existing feature must follow this model split:

1. **Plan with Fable** (fall back to Opus only if Fable is unavailable). Enter plan mode, design the implementation, and present the plan to the user for approval or modification. Do not start implementing until the user approves the plan.
2. **Implement with Sonnet.** Once the plan is approved, carry out the implementation using Sonnet (e.g. by delegating the implementation steps to Sonnet subagents via the Agent tool with `model: "sonnet"`).
3. **Review with Fable** (fall back to Opus only if Fable is unavailable). After implementation, all work must be reviewed by Fable before it is considered done.

**PR reviews** must also use Fable, with Opus as the fallback if Fable is unavailable.
