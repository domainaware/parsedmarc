``parsedmarc`` is a Python module and CLI utility for parsing DMARC reports.
When used with Elasticsearch and Kibana, it works as a self-hosted open source
alternative to commercial DMARC report processing services such as Agari,
Dmarcian, and OnDMARC.

Features
========

* Parses draft and 1.0 standard aggregate/rua reports
* Parses forensic/failure/ruf reports
* Can parse reports from an inbox over IMAP
* Transparently handles gzip or zip compressed reports
* Consistent data structures
* Simple JSON and/or CSV output
* Optionally email the results
* Optionally send the results to Elasticsearch, for use with premade Kibana
  dashboards

Resources
=========

* `Demystifying DMARC`_

SPF and DMARC record validation
===============================

If you are looking for SPF and DMARC record validation and parsing,
check out the sister project,
`checkdmarc <https://domainaware.github.io/checkdmarc/>`_.

Sample aggregate report output
==============================

Here are the results from parsing the `example <https://dmarc.org/wiki/FAQ#I_need_to_implement_aggregate_reports.2C_what_do_they_look_like.3F>`_
report from the dmarc.org wiki. It's actually an older draft of the the 1.0
report schema standardized in
`RFC 7480 Appendix C <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489#appendix-C>`_.
This draft schema is still in wide use.

``parsedmarc`` produces consistent, normalized output, regardless of the report
schema.

Sample forensic report output
=============================

I don't have a sample I can share for privacy reasons. If you have a sample
forensic report that you can share publicly, please contact me!

Bug reports
===========

Please report bugs on the GitHub issue tracker

https://github.com/domainaware/parsedmarc/issues

Installation
============

``parsedmarc`` works with Python 3 only.

On Debian or Ubuntu systems, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip


Python 3 installers for Windows and macOS can be found at
https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install or upgrade to the latest stable release of ``parsedmarc`` on
macOS or Linux, run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -H pip3 install -U parsedmarc

Or, install the latest development release directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -H pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/domainaware/parsedmarc.git

.. note::

    On Windows, ``pip3`` is ``pip``, even with Python 3. So on Windows, simply
    substitute ``pip`` as an administrator in place of ``sudo pip3``, in the
    above commands.


Installation using pypy3
------------------------

For the best possible processing speed, consider using `parsedmarc` inside a ``pypy3``
virtualenv. First, `download the latest version of pypy3`_. Extract it to
``/opt/pypy3`` (``sudo mkdir /opt`` if ``/opt`` does not exist), then create a
symlink:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo ln -s /opt/pypy3/bin/pypy3 /usr/local/bin/pypy3

Install ``virtualenv`` on your system:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    $ sudo -H pip3 install -U virtualenv

Uninstall any instance of ``parsedmarc`` that you may have installed globally

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -H pip3 uninstall -y parsedmarc

Next, create a ``pypy3`` virtualenv for parsedmarc


.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo mkdir /opt/venvs
    $ cd /opt/venvs
    $ sudo -H pip3 install -U virtualenv
    $ sudo virtualenv --download -p /usr/local/bin/pypy3 parsedmarc
    $ sudo -H /opt/venvs/parsedmarc/bin/pip3 install -U parsedmarc
    $ sudo ln -s /opt/venvs/parsedmarc/bin/parsedmarc /usr/local/bin/parsedmarc

To upgrade ``parsedmarc`` inside the virtualenv, run:


.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -H /opt/venvs/parsedmarc/bin/pip3 install -U parsedmarc

Or, install the latest development release directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -H /opt/venvs/parsedmarc/bin/pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/domainaware/parsedmarc.git

Optional dependencies
---------------------

If you would like to be able to parse emails saved from Microsoft Outlook
(i.e. OLE .msg files), install ``msgconvert``:

On Debian or Ubuntu systems, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install libemail-outlook-message-perl


DNS performance
---------------

You can often improve performance by providing one or more local nameservers
to the CLI or function calls, as long as those nameservers return the same
records as the public DNS.


.. note::

   If you do not specify any nameservers, Cloudflare's public nameservers are
   used by default, **not the system's default nameservers**.

   This is done to avoid a situation where records in a local nameserver do
   not match records in the public DNS.

Testing multiple report analyzers
---------------------------------

If you would like to test parsedmarc and another report processing solution
at the same time, you can have up to two mailto URIs each in the rua and ruf
tags tgs in your DMARC record, separated by commas.

Elasticsearch and Kibana
------------------------

To set up visual dashboards of DMARC data, install Elasticsearch and Kibana.

.. note::

    Elasticsearch/Kibana 6 is required

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jre apt-transport-https
    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y elasticsearch kibana
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
    sudo systemctl enable kibana.service
    sudo service start elasticsearch
    sudo service start kibana

Without the commercial X-Pack_, Kibana does not have any authentication
mechanism of its own. You can use nginx as a reverse proxy that provides basic
authentication.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install -y nginx apache2-utils

Create a directory to store the certificates and keys:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir ~/ssl
    cd ~/ssl

To create a self-signed certificate, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout kibana.key -out kibana.crt

Or, to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a CA, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    openssl req -newkey rsa:4096-nodes -keyout kibana.key -out kibana.csr

Fill in the prompts. Watch out for Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR
domain name), which is the IP address or domain name that you will be hosting
Kibana on. it is the most important field.

If you generated a CSR, remove the CSR after you have your certs

.. code-block:: bash

    rm -f kibana.csr


Move the keys into place and secure them:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd
    sudo mv ssl /etc/nginx
    sudo chown -R root:www-data /etc/nginx/ssl
    sudo chmod -R u=rX,g=rX,o= /etc/nginx/ssl

Disable the default nginx configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Create the web server configuration

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/kibana

.. code-block:: nginx

   server {
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/kibana.crt;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/kibana.key;
       ssl_session_timeout 1d;
       ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:50m;
       ssl_session_tickets off;


       # modern configuration. tweak to your needs.
       ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
       ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256';
       ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

       # Uncomment this next line if you are using a signed, trusted cert
       #add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains; preload";
       add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
       add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
       auth_basic "Login required";
       auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/htpasswd;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5601;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       }
   }

   server {
       listen 80;
       return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
   }


Enable the nginx configuration for Kibana:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/kibana /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/kibana

Add a user to basic authentication:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/htpasswd exampleuser

Where ``exampleuser`` is the name of the user you want to add.

Secure the permissions of the httpasswd file:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo chown root:www-data /etc/nginx/htpasswd
    sudo chmod u=rw,g=r,o= /etc/nginx/htpasswd

Restart nginx:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo service nginx restart


Now that Elasticsearch is up and running, use ``parsedmarc`` to send data to
it.

Om the same system as Elasticsearch, pass ``--save-aggregate`` and/or
``--save-forensic`` to ``parsedmarc`` save the results in Elasticsearch.

.. warning::

    ``--save-aggregate`` and ``--save-forensic`` are separate options because
    you may not want to save forensic reports (also known as failure reports)
    to your Elasticsearch instance, particularly if you are in a
    highly-regulated industry that handles sensitive data, such as healthcare
    or finance. If your legitimate outgoing email fails DMARC, it is possible
    that email may appear later in a forensic report.

    Forensic reports contain the original headers of an email that failed a
    DMARC check, and sometimes may also include the full message body,
    depending on the policy of the reporting organization.

    Most reporting organizations do not send forensic reports of any kind for
    privacy reasons. While aggregate DMARC reports are sent at least daily,
    it is normal to receive very few forensic reports.


When you first visit Kibana, it will prompt you to create an index pattern.
Start by creating the index pattern ``dmarc_aggregate`` (without an ``*``),
and select ``date_range`` as the time field. Once the ``dmarc_aggregate``
index pattern ``dmarc_aggregate`` has been saved, create a ``dmarc_forensic``
index pattern, with ``arrival_date`` as the time field.

.. image:: _static/screenshots/define-dmarc-aggregate.png

   :alt: A screenshot of setting the time field for the dmarc_forensic index pattern
   :align: center
   :target: _static/screenshots/dmarc-forensic-time-field.png

Once the index patterns have been created, you can import the dashboards.

Download (right click the link and click save as) kibana_saved_objects.json_.

Import ``kibana_saved_objects.json`` the Saved Objects tab of the management
page of Kibana.

It will give you the option to overwrite existing saved dashboards or
visualizations, which could be used to restore them if you or someone else
breaks them, as there are no permissions/access controls in Kibana without
the commercial X-Pack_.

.. image:: _static/screenshots/confirm-overwrite.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the overwrite conformation prompt
   :align: center
   :target: _static/screenshots/confirm-overwrite.png

Kibana will then ask you to match the newly imported objects to your index
patterns. Select ``dmarc_forensic`` for the set of forensic objects, and
select ``dmarc_aggregate`` for the other saved objects, as shown below.

Running parsedmarc as a systemd service
---------------------------------------

Use systemd to run ``parsedmarc`` as a service and process reports as they
arrive.

Create the service configuration file

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/parsedmarc.service

.. code-block:: ini

    [Unit]
    Description=parsedmarc mailbox watcher
    Documentation=https://domainaware.github.io/parsedmarc/
    Wants=network-online.target
    After=network.target network-online.target elasticsearch.service

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/parsedmarc --watch --silent --save-aggregate --save-forensic -H "outlook.office365.com" -u "dmarc@example.com" -p "FooBar!"
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5m

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Edit the command line options of ``parsedmarc`` in the service's ``ExecStart``
setting to suit your needs.

.. note::

    Always pass the ``--watch`` option to ``parsedmarc`` when running it as a
    service. Use ``--silent`` to only log errors.

.. warning::

    As mentioned earlier, forensic/failure reports contain copies of emails
    that failed DMARC, including emails that may be legitimate and contain
    sensitive customer or business information. For privacy and/or regulatory
    reasons, you may not want to use the ``--save-forensic`` flag included in
    the example service configuration ``ExecStart`` setting, which would save
    these samples to Elasticsearch.

Then, enable the service

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable parsedmarc.service
    sudo service parsedmarc restart

.. note::

    You must also run the above commands whenever you edit
    ``parsedmarc.service``.

Use this command to check the status of the service:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo service parsedmarc status

.. warning::

    Always restart the service every time you upgrade to a new version of
    ``parsedmarc``:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo service parsedmarc restart


Using the Kibana dashboards
===========================

The Kibana DMARC dashboards are a human-friendly way to understand the results
from incoming DMARC reports.

.. note::

    The default dashboard is DMARC Summary. To switch between dashboards,
    click on the Dashboard link in the left side menu of Kibana.


DMARC Summary
-------------

As the name suggests, this dashboard is the best place to start reviewing your
aggregate DMARC data.

Across the top of the dashboard, three pie charts display the percentage of
alignment pass/fail for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. Clicking on any chart segment
will filter for that value.

.. note::

    Messages should not be considered malicious just because they failed to pass
    DMARC; especially if you have just started collecting data. It may be a
    legitimate service that needs SPF and DKIM configured correctly.

Start by filtering the results to only show failed DKIM alignment. While DMARC
passes if a message passes SPF or DKIM alignment, only DKIM alignment remains
valid when a message is forwarded without changing the from address, which is
often caused by a mailbox forwarding rule. This is because DKIM signatures are
part of the message headers, whereas SPF relies on SMTP session headers.

Underneath the pie charts. you can see graphs of DMARC passage and message
disposition over time.

Under the graphs you will find the most useful data tables on the dashboard. On
the left, there is a list of organizations that are sending you DMARC reports.
In the center, there is a list of sending servers grouped by the base domain
in their reverse DNS. On the right, there is a list of email from domains,
sorted by message volume.

By hovering your mouse over a data table value and using the magnifying glass
icons, you can filter on our filter out different values. Start by looking at
the Message Sources by Reverse DNS table. Find a sender that you recognize,
such as an email marketing service, hover over it, and click on the plus (+)
magnifying glass icon, to add a filter that only shows results for that sender.
Now, look at the Message From Header table to the right. That shows you the
domains that a sender is sending as, which might tell you which brand/business
is using a particular service. With that information, you can contact them and
have them set up DKIM.

.. note::
  
    If you have a lot of B2C customers, you may see a high volume of emails as
    your domains coming from consumer email services, such as Google/Gmail and
    Yahoo! This occurs when customers have mailbox rules in place that forward
    emails from an old account to a new account, which is why DKIM
    authentication is so important, as mentioned earlier. Similar patterns may
    be observed with businesses who send from reverse DNS addressees of
    parent, subsidiary, and outdated brands.


Further down the dashboard, you can filter by source country or source IP
address.

Tables showing SPF and DKIM alignment details are located under the IP address
table.

.. note::

    Previously, the alignment tables were included in a separate dashboard
    called DMARC Alignment Failures. That dashboard has been consolidated into
    the DMARC Summary dashboard. To view failures only, use the pie chart.

Any other filters work the same way. You can also add your own custom temporary
filters by clicking on Add Filter at the upper right of the page.

DMARC Forensic Samples
----------------------

The DMARC Forensic Samples dashboard contains information on DMARC forensic
reports (also known as failure reports or ruf reports). These reports contain
samples of emails that have failed to pass DMARC.

.. note::

    Most recipients do not send forensic/failure/ruf reports at all to avoid
    privacy leaks. Some recipients (notably Chinese webmail services) will only
    supply the headers of sample emails. Very few provide the entire email.


DMARC Alignment Guide
=====================

DMARC ensures that SPF and DKM authentication mechanisms actually authenticate
against the same domain that the end user sees.

A message passes a DMARC check by passing DKIM or SPF, **as long as the related
indicators are also in alignment**.

What if a sender won't support DKIM/DMARC?
==========================================

#. Some vendors don’t know about DMARC yet; ask about SPF and DKIM/email
   authentication.
#. Check if they can send through your email relays instead of theirs.
#. Do they really need to spoof your domain? Why not use the display
   name instead?
#. Worst case, have that vendor send email as a specific subdomain of
   your domain (e.g. ``noreply@news.example.com``), and then create
   separate SPF and DMARC records on ``news.example.com``, and set
   ``p=none`` in that DMARC record.

 .. warning ::

     Do not alter the ``p`` or ``sp`` values of the DMARC record on the
     Top-Level Domain (TLD) – that would leave you vulnerable to spoofing of
     your TLD and/or any subdomain.
