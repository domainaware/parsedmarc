`parsedmarc` is a Python module and CLI utility for parsing DMARC reports.
When used with Elasticsearch and Kibana (or Splunk), it works as a self-hosted
open source alternative to commercial DMARC report processing services such
as Agari Brand Protection, Dmarcian, OnDMARC, ProofPoint Email Fraud Defense,
and Valimail.

## Features

- Parses draft and 1.0 standard aggregate/rua reports
- Parses forensic/failure/ruf reports
- Can parse reports from an inbox over IMAP, Microsoft Graph, or Gmail API
- Transparently handles gzip or zip compressed reports
- Consistent data structures
- Simple JSON and/or CSV output
- Optionally email the results
- Optionally send the results to Elasticsearch and/or Splunk, for use with
  premade dashboards
- Optionally send reports to Apache Kafka
