# Elasticsearch and Kibana

To set up visual dashboards of DMARC data, install Elasticsearch and Kibana.

:::{note}
Elasticsearch and Kibana 6 or later are required
:::

## Installation

On Debian/Ubuntu based systems, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y elasticsearch kibana
```

For CentOS, RHEL, and other RPM systems, follow the Elastic RPM guides for
[Elasticsearch] and [Kibana].

:::{note}
Previously, the default JVM heap size for Elasticsearch was very small (1g),
which will cause it to crash under a heavy load. To fix this, increase the
minimum and maximum JVM heap sizes in `/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options` to
more reasonable levels, depending on your server's resources.

Make sure the system has at least 2 GB more RAM than the assigned JVM
heap size.

Always set the minimum and maximum JVM heap sizes to the same
value.

For example, to set a 4 GB heap size, set

```bash
-Xms4g
-Xmx4g
```

See <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/important-settings.html#heap-size-settings>
for more information.
:::

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
sudo systemctl enable kibana.service
sudo service elasticsearch start
sudo service kibana start
```

As of Elasticsearch 8.7, activate secure mode (xpack.security.*.ssl)

```bash
sudo vim /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
```

Add the following configuration

```text
# Enable security features
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.enrollment.enabled: true
# Enable encryption for HTTP API client connections, such as Kibana, Logstash, and Agents
xpack.security.http.ssl:
  enabled: true
  keystore.path: certs/http.p12
# Enable encryption and mutual authentication between cluster nodes
xpack.security.transport.ssl:
  enabled: true
  verification_mode: certificate
  keystore.path: certs/transport.p12
  truststore.path: certs/transport.p12
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch
```

To create a self-signed certificate, run:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout kibana.key -out kibana.crt
```

Or, to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a CA, run:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096-nodes -keyout kibana.key -out kibana.csr
```

Fill in the prompts. Watch out for Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR
domain name), which is the IP address or domain name that you will use to access Kibana. it is the most important field.

If you generated a CSR, remove the CSR after you have your certs

```bash
rm -f kibana.csr
```

Move the keys into place and secure them:

```bash
sudo mv kibana.* /etc/kibana
sudo chmod 660 /etc/kibana/kibana.key
```

Activate the HTTPS server in Kibana

```bash
sudo vim /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
```

Add the following configuration

```text
server.host: "SERVER_IP"
server.publicBaseUrl: "https://SERVER_IP"
server.ssl.enabled: true
server.ssl.certificate: /etc/kibana/kibana.crt
server.ssl.key: /etc/kibana/kibana.key
```

:::{note}
For more security, you can configure Kibana to use a local network connexion
to elasticsearch :
```text
elasticsearch.hosts: ['https://SERVER_IP:9200']
```
=> 
```text
elasticsearch.hosts: ['https://127.0.0.1:9200']
```
:::

```bash
sudo systemctl restart kibana
```

Enroll Kibana in Elasticsearch

```bash
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
```

Then access to your web server at `https://SERVER_IP:5601`, accept the self-signed
certificate and paste the token in the "Enrollment token" field.

```bash
sudo /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-verification-code
```

Then put the verification code to your web browser.

End Kibana configuration

```bash
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
sudo /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-encryption-keys generate
sudo vim /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
```

Add previously generated encryption keys

```text
xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: xxxx...xxxx
xpack.reporting.encryptionKey: xxxx...xxxx
xpack.security.encryptionKey: xxxx...xxxx
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart kibana
sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch
```

Now that Elasticsearch is up and running, use `parsedmarc` to send data to
it.

Download (right-click the link and click save as) [export.ndjson].

Connect to kibana using the "elastic" user and the password you previously provide
on the console ("End Kibana configuration" part).

Import `export.ndjson` the Saved Objects tab of the Stack management
page of Kibana. (Hamburger menu -> "Management" -> "Stack Management" ->
"Kibana" -> "Saved Objects")

It will give you the option to overwrite existing saved dashboards or
visualizations, which could be used to restore them if you or someone else
breaks them, as there are no permissions/access controls in Kibana without
the commercial [X-Pack].

## Upgrading Kibana index patterns

`parsedmarc` 5.0.0 makes some changes to the way data is indexed in
Elasticsearch. if you are upgrading from a previous release of
`parsedmarc`, you need to complete the following steps to replace the
Kibana index patterns with versions that match the upgraded indexes:

1. Login in to Kibana, and click on Management
2. Under Kibana, click on Saved Objects
3. Check the checkboxes for the `dmarc_aggregate` and `dmarc_forensic`
   index patterns
4. Click Delete
5. Click Delete on the conformation message
6. Download (right-click the link and click save as)
   the latest version of [export.ndjson]
7. Import `export.ndjson` by clicking Import from the Kibana
   Saved Objects page

## Records retention

Starting in version 5.0.0, `parsedmarc` stores data in a separate
index for each day to make it easy to comply with records
retention regulations such as GDPR. For more information,
check out the Elastic guide to [managing time-based indexes efficiently](https://www.elastic.co/blog/managing-time-based-indices-efficiently).
